The following files may need to be edited for specific configs:

1. aggregatorConfig.py -- top level aggregator config properties:
    == discoverRackServersFrom=discovery-dflt.json        # or file with similar contents--the discovered servers
    == redfishAggregatorIsInsideSwitch = True             # for aggregator running inside Cumulus
                                                          #  set False if aggregator is in separate server or appliance
    == isRackSim=False                                    # for real HW
    == includeRackScaleOemProperties=True                 # for RSD support

    == pduReseatScriptApp="python2"                       # the linux app used to run the pduReseatScript (bash, python3, python2...)
    == pduReseatScript="pduReseatScript-dflt.py"          # script to run that should match the pdu

    == bmcCredentialsFile="bmcCredentials-dflt.json"      # in /CREDENTIALS/ --credential file that matches the bmc credentials

    -- various Rack Enclosure settings eg RackModelNum
    -- various Management Switch settings eg ModelNum
    -- various Aggregator "Manager" settings eg Id, Model...



2. backendRoot.py -- ONLY if we need to modify paths to RedDrum.conf, or script files used by the backend

3. pduReseatScript-apc.py -- ONLY if additional customization of the PDU interface is required

4. bmcCredentials-idrac.json -- ONLY if wanting to use idrac credentials other than defaults rood:calvin
