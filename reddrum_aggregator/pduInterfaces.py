    # Send Command to the smart PDU that powers the Rack Servers
    # the method runs a script that uses telnet/ssh to send commands to the PDU
    # It is used to execute the server Reseat by executing a power-off and then power-on 
    #    to a PDU socket to effectively "reseat" the server
    # Other PDU commands may be added to power-on, power-off, or read-power from the socket
    # If the script takes a long time to run, it should return and run a subshell in background
    #
    # Input parameters:
    #     chasId -- a string that identifies the server - same as switch port 
    #     chasBmcNetloc -- string that is the netloc (IPaddr[:<port>] to the server's BMC
    #     pduSocketId -- a string that MAY be used by the script to id a specific pdu socket
    #     pduCommand  -- a string that indicates the command to the PDU.  pduCommands include:
    #         "RESEAT" -- power-off then power-on the server
    #          ...
    #   If pduSocketId is not specified then an empty string ("") is passed to the script
    #        and the script must lookup the pdu based on chasId and chasBmcNetloc
    #   pduSocketId and chasId cannot both be None/""
    #
    # The routine uses Popen to run the script and returns: 
    #    1) the script exit code, -- so the script should ALWAYS exit with bash command "exit <exitcode>"
    #         -- exitcode = 0 if success. 
    #         -- exitcode = non-0 results in a 500 error to the rest api
    #    2) stdout   -- used to send response data in form of a proper Json Struct.  send {} if no output
    #    3) stderr.  -- may be used for error and debug
